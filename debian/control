Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 This module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling.  Secondly "Error" is a
 base class for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for
 subsequent catch, or can simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the
 user should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
